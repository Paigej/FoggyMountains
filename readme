How to Run
----------

make; ./foggymountains

Summary
-------
I created a mountain range using a heightmap by computing hight values from color and then overlaying a colored version of the hight map as a texture, to create depth.  I also added fog to the mountains to create a "snowy mountain effect."  I turned off all ambient lighting to create the dark mysterious effect.

The camera is designed to simulate flight, and works best by clicking the mouse and draging it around the screen. You can roll with q and e 

The "dragon" that is flying can shoot out "fireballs" to light up the scene.
